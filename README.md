## üèÜ Project Title

**AI-Powered Low-Light Image Enhancer using Fine-Tuned ESRGAN & SwinIR**  
üèÖ *Ranked #1 among 200+ participants ‚Äì DLP Jan 2025 (NPPE3) | IIT Madras*

---

## üìå Overview

This project is a full-stack AI-powered image enhancement application built as part of the **Deep Learning Practice (DLP) course at IIT Madras**. The goal was to denoise and upscale low-light images using cutting-edge deep learning models.

After training and fine-tuning on a Kaggle notebook, the enhanced models were integrated into a **FastAPI** backend and served through a clean and responsive **HTML/CSS UI** for real-time inference.

## üöÄ Features

- üîç **4x Super-Resolution**: Upscale blurry or pixelated images with enhanced detail.
- üåô **Low-Light Denoising**: Automatically reduces noise in poorly-lit photos.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Fine-Tuned Models**:
  - ‚úÖ [Real-ESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN) (for natural image restoration)
  - ‚úÖ [SwinIR](https://github.com/JingyunLiang/SwinIR) (Transformer-based image restoration)
- üñºÔ∏è **FastAPI App**:
  - Upload images
  - View enhanced results instantly
  - Download the enhanced image
- üí° **Responsive UI**: Built with Jinja2, HTML5, and CSS3
- üîê **Offline Inference**: Fully self-contained application; no external API calls

## üß† Models and Training

The Real-ESRGAN and SwinIR models were fine-tuned using a Kaggle notebook on a dataset of low-light, noisy images. The training pipeline includes:

- Noise augmentation
- Low-light simulation
- Custom loss function (Perceptual + PSNR)
- Visual validation using SSIM metrics

> ‚ú® The models were exported and optimized for local inference in this application.
